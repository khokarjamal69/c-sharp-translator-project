# c-sharp-translator-project
It is a simple language translator in C# using google API.

It is a C Shpart Windows Fom Application that translates text and does text to speach. It uses Google translation API for traslating between languages.

The code also has Google Speach API which I used to get text from an mp3 file stored in system. I mistakenly deleted the Speach to Text code but anyone can search the internet for the code.

Google API use an API key and an Application name to function. In order to get the API key and Application name, you need to go to http://console.cloud.google.com/, create a project and enable billing. The API will not work unil the billing is enabled via credit card. Google does not deduct any amount until the free trial of around 300 days ends.
You can add multiple APIs in a single project.

Download and unzip the project. 
It is mentioned where to put API key and Application name. The source language is automatically chosen by the API and target language needs to be selected.
